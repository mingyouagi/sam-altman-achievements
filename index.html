            <div class="card">
                <p>As the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman is leading the charge in artificial intelligence research and development. The company's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity.</p>
                <p>Under Altman's guidance, OpenAI has developed and released groundbreaking AI models, most notably the GPT series and ChatGPT, which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation.</p>
                <p>The release of ChatGPT led to massive user adoption and significantly increased OpenAI's valuation and revenue. A strategic partnership with Microsoft has provided OpenAI with substantial resources and infrastructure to further its research efforts.</p>
                <p>Altman spearheaded the transition of OpenAI to a capped-profit model, balancing the pursuit of commercial success with the commitment to responsible AI development.</p>
                <p>His leadership, however, has not been without controversy, including a temporary ouster in November 2023 due to internal disagreements over transparency and safety, and public criticism from figures like Geoffrey Hinton and Jan Leike who expressed concerns about prioritizing commercialization over safety.</p>
                <p>Despite overseeing a multi-billion dollar company, Altman's official salary is modest, and he holds no direct equity in OpenAI.</p>

                <p>Sam Altman's career has been marked by several controversies and challenges. His brief ouster from OpenAI in November 2023 exposed internal conflicts regarding transparency, safety, and his leadership style.</p>
                <p>His public feud with Elon Musk stems from Musk's claims that OpenAI has deviated from its original non-profit mission.</p>
                <p>The Worldcoin project, co-founded by Altman, has faced global regulatory scrutiny and criticism over its use of biometric data (iris scanning) for identity verification and its potential privacy implications.</p>
                <p>OpenAI has also faced criticism regarding its labor practices, specifically the use of outsourced data labelers, and the environmental impact associated with training large AI models.</p>
                <p>Additionally, his extensive investment portfolio has led to questions about potential conflicts of interest with his leadership role at OpenAI. Personal allegations against Altman have also surfaced, which he denies.</p>
